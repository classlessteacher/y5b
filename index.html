<p><span style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>our job:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 22px;">our science teacher Jason Reardon gave us a job to make something to do with a problem people are facing or medical problems throughout the world. We chose Covid-19 because everybody knows it is killing thousands of people and we thought we can do resperators because countries are fighting it and we wanted to help
 .We think that our respirator/mask is much better than a normal respirator/mask you buy in Amazon. We think that our mask is better because we have filters and proper fabric that people who make masks use to make them.</span><div style="color: red">Word to HTML trial - please <a href="https://wordtohtml.net/site/payment">Go PRO</a> to get whole HTML.</div>

masks are very important in this time of the pandemic
<p>we used this theory that the more thick a matirial is the more harder it is to pass through. I say that because the carona virus is made out of bad little molecules and that can pass through your body.</p><div style="color: red">Word to HTML trial - please <a href="https://wordtohtml.net/site/payment">Go PRO</a> to get whole HTML.</div>
